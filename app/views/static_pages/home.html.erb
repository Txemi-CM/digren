	<h2>A new era for Dreamers</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>We are entering a new era. It promises prosperity and richness of ideas as never before.</li>
		<li>Never before mankind had the means to supply food, clothes and shelter for all. Never before were humans freed from physical labor as now.</li>
		<li>Never was as easy to create and spread ideas. The open source movement wins. The more you share your idea the more valuable it gets.</li>
		<li>Beyond the knowledge and creative worker, it's time for the artistic worker.</li>
		<li>Business and work must have a purpose. Business can not be just about profits anymore.</li>
		<li>We need more dreamers, willing to bet all on their beliefs.</li>
	</ul>
